\section{Motivation}

% [FIXED] Cohort/Team Selection vs Aspirational Quota Selection – The football example used to open the introduction is a fun example, but it would seem to differ significantly from the selection scenarios you focus on in the thesis. How does choosing candidates for scholarship applications, hiring, or university admissions differ from team/cohort selection, as in the football case?  For instance, this often requires assembling groups with specific, predefined compositions. In contrast, the other scenarios generally aim to meet aspirational diversity goals across the entire intake, with metrics analysed post-hoc rather than determining each group's precise makeup. This raises an important question: how do the methods presented in your thesis apply to strict compositional requirements compared to broader, trend-focused selection goals?  (You may, in fact, want to discuss this in 1.2. Scope and Terms as well–as all selection problems aren't equal, it might be useful to introduce fundamental terms relating to different kinds of candidate selection to better define the scope. )

Consider a prestigious global scholarship program receiving thousands of applications from aspiring scholars worldwide. The selection committee faces a complex decision: from this diverse pool of talented individuals, they must choose a cohort that will best advance the program's mission to develop future leaders who will tackle global challenges. Unlike a simple ranking of academic merit, this selection process involves balancing multiple, sometimes competing values. Should they prioritise applicants with the highest test scores, those who demonstrate the greatest potential for social impact, candidates from underrepresented regions, or individuals who have overcome significant adversity? The committee's approach will depend on how they interpret the program's goals and what they believe constitutes the ``best'' cohort, and this decision carries profound implications for both the selected scholars and the communities they will eventually serve.

This ``selection problem'', choosing whom to include, echoes throughout society. Employers select whom to hire. Creditors select whom they lend to. Universities select whom to admit. Scholarship programmes, like our hypothetical one, select whom to award. An organisation's goals and values determine its selections. An employer may seek the best candidate for a specific task, while a creditor seeks debtors likely to repay loans. Universities and scholarship programmes, however, often differ. Their selection is not for organisational benefit but for a social one \cite{Warikoo_2019}. Thus, instead of selecting only applicants who yield the best returns to the organisation, they seek to select those who are most deserving, will learn the most, have the greatest need, whose presence will benefit others, or who will use their education to most improve society.\footnote{Hirers and lenders are often bound by law to select the most deserving, and they occasionally select those who will benefit others. However, these institutions are generally motivated to maximise profits within legal bounds \cite{schmidt1998validity}.}

Although a wealth of research explores when and how algorithms can make hiring or lending decisions (and whether they should) \cite{schmidt1998validity,schumann2017diverse,raghavan2020mitigating,horodyski_applicants_2023,Leung_Zhang_Jibuti_Zhao_Klein_Pierce_Robert_Zhu_2020}, little research explores how algorithms can support selection decisions in the scholarship context. The research that exists in the university context often likens this problem more to hiring than to scholarship \cite{schumann2017diverse,Steel_Multiple_2018,ijcai2023p819}. Furthermore, just as research on hiring and lending finds flaws in many applications of algorithms \cite{raghavan2020mitigating,horodyski_applicants_2023,Peng_Nushi_Kıcıman_Inkpen_Suri_Kamar_2019}, the scant research on human-led scholarship and university selection finds similar problems \cite{schumann2017diverse}.

In a world flattened by the global proliferation of technology \cite{Friedman_2005}, new global scholarship initiatives aim to select scholars from every part of the world. These programmes offer applicants worldwide access to educational resources that may have previously been inaccessible, but they also exacerbate the problems found in related work. If these programmes can select the ``best'' cohorts, they can deliver on their stated missions to improve the world by broadening access to elite higher education and training scholars to solve the world's most significant problems. This thesis aims to enable that mission by supporting these selection processes with algorithmic decision-support tools.

% [FIXED] Scope – Despite the title, the section doesn't establish a scope – e.g. what is in and what is out of scope of this thesis.  What sort of selection problems are within scope and what is not? More importantly, the questions you present in this section read like research questions; indeed, it is appropriate for introductions of theses to articulate a set of central research questions for the entire thesis.  However, it is unclear that these questions relate to some of the chapters; ensure they are able to admit and support the work on explanations (Ch 4), AI based plagiarism (Ch5), or even very much to Chapter 6.  Also, in RQ1 you mention applicant-based decisions and cohort-based decisions interchangeably – are they both in scope?
\section{Scope of the Thesis}

Global scholarship programs, such as the Rise and Ellison Scholars programmes, with whom we conducted this research, face daunting challenges in their mission to select and cultivate future leaders. These challenges include navigating different interpretations of the ``best'' cohort, ensuring fair comparisons of applicants from diverse global contexts, and mitigating risks such as applicants using generative AI to misrepresent their aptitude. Existing low-tech decision-making systems are often unequipped to handle these newfound complexities \cite{Latzer_Hollnbuchner_Just_Saurwein_2014}. While selection practitioners (selectors) design innovative solutions, they often lack easy access to the information needed to robustly support their decisions.

With now all selection problems being equal, to properly define this thesis's scope, we must distinguish between different types of candidate selection, and narrow our scope to the kind of problem at hand. We identify two primary categories of selection that differ fundamentally in their approach and objectives:

\paragraph{Strict Quota Selection} involves assembling groups with specific, predefined compositions to fulfil particular functional requirements. Examples include selecting a sports team where specific positions must be filled (e.g., two defenders, two midfielders, and one goalkeeper) or hiring a team of specific roles (e.g., one software engineer and one salesperson). In these contexts, selectors know in advance how many individuals with particular characteristics they need. The selection process is constrained by these structural requirements, and success requires that the final composition match the predetermined template, but is otherwise evaluated by evaluating each individual independently.

\paragraph{Aspirational Selection} aims to meet broader diversity and excellence goals across an entire intake rather than strictly constraining each individual selection decision. This approach characterises most scholarship, university admissions, and similar social programmes. Selectors work toward aspirational targets (e.g., achieving geographic diversity or representing underrepresented groups) but do not have strict quotas. Here, these compositional elements are a goal, rather than a constraint. Success is evaluated by examining whether the cohort reflects the programme's values and mission, which requires considering the group holistically.

This thesis focuses primarily on \emph{Aspirational Selection}, as global scholarship programmes like Rise and Ellison Scholars primarily use \emph{Aspirational Selection} to achieve diversity and excellence. We designed the methods and tools herein to support selection processes where values-based decision-making predominates over structural composition requirements and where the ``best'' cohort is determined by balancing multiple competing objectives rather than fulfilling predetermined quotas.\footnote{Historically, some programmes have used \emph{Strict Quota Selection} as a means of operationalising the aspirational goals of the programme in structures that allow stakeholders to evaluate the programme, but this process has fallen out of favour and is not used by either the Rise or Ellison Scholars programmes.}

% [FIXED] You discuss "competing values" abstractly. Can you give some examples of values?  Please include "values" as a key term, and examples of these.

\paragraph{Values} In scholarship selection, a programme's values are the fundamental principles that guide decisions about which applicants to select. Common values include: \emph{academic excellence} (prioritising applicants with high test scores or grades); \emph{potential for social impact} (favouring candidates with compelling visions for addressing global challenges); \emph{diversity} (seeking applicants from a variety of backgrounds); \emph{need} (supporting those with limited access to education); \emph{integrity} (valuing truth-seeking and truth-telling); or \emph{resilience} (recognising applicants who have overcome adversity). These values often conflict; an applicant with top academic credentials may not show the greatest potential for social impact, and those with the greatest need may not come from the most underrepresented regions. In practice, these conflicts lead to vastly different understandings of the ``best'' cohort \cite{zimmerman_research_2014}. Selectors must balance these competing values to select cohorts that best embody their programme's mission.

We term the primary decision to overcome this conflict \emph{Selection}: choosing the most apt cohort of applicants according to a specific organisation set of values. This central decision is supported by many subordinate decisions, such as: ``What criteria make one applicant (or cohort) more apt than another?'' and ``How can we apply these criteria to select the most apt cohort?'' Each subordinate decision is itself supported by further decisions regarding programme purpose, metrics, and their application.

The scope of this thesis is the development and evaluation of Decision Support Tools (DSTs) to enhance \emph{Selection} processes within global scholarship programmes. Specifically, it focuses on building and assessing DSTs that address three critical challenges selectors face:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How to ensure that AI recommendations are interpretable and trustworthy (Chapter \ref{ch:xai}).
    \item How to maintain integrity when applicants may use generative AI (Chapter \ref{ch:genai}).
    \item How to understand, operationalise, and foster diversity within selected cohorts (Chapters \ref{ch:diversity} and \ref{ch:spf}).
\end{enumerate}

We conducted this research in collaboration with Rise and Ellison Scholars. While this thesis engages with the ethical dimensions of AI-supported selection, it does not aim to provide definitive solutions to all underlying societal inequities. Instead, it seeks to improve the tools and processes available to selectors. We acknowledge work outside this direct scope, such as critical theory perspectives on selection, in Chapter \ref{ch:discussion}.

\section{Research Questions}

This thesis is guided by the following central research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1:}] How can Decision Support Tools (DSTs) be effectively designed, implemented, and evaluated to aid selectors in global talent investment programs in making values-driven selection decisions that balance multifaceted objectives like excellence, diversity, and fairness, across both aspirational quota and cohort-based selection paradigms?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2:}] In what ways do emerging AI technologies, particularly explainable AI (XAI) and generative AI (GenAI), impact the decision-making processes, integrity, and perceived legitimacy of scholarship selection, and what frameworks or interventions can mitigate potential harms while leveraging benefits for selectors?
    \item[\textbf{RQ3:}] How can complex and evolving conceptualizations of diversity be translated into practical support mechanisms within DSTs to assist scholarship programs in achieving their diversity-related goals, and what is the real-world efficacy of such mechanisms when deployed in live selection processes?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contributions} 
The contributions of this thesis are twofold. There are meta-level conceptual distinctions introduced, and also some substantive contributions associated with body chapters.

The meta-level contributions of this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of decision points facing scholarship programmes uncovered through longitudinal HCI research with Rise and Ellison Scholars.
    \item The SOAI paradigm for designing AI systems that support one of the social benefits of good selection processes.
    \item A set of design recommendations for designers seeking to apply SOAI to build a DST to support selectors.
\end{itemize}

However, this thesis is composed of several papers that make more specific, core contributions to support tools seeking to solve issues of Explainability, Plagiarism, and Diversity. These are detailed in the relevant chapters but are also described here.

\paragraph{Explainability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantitative findings indicating that the problem of explanation-induced unwarranted trust extends to generic post-hoc justifications, but that such criticism only applies in process (Chapter \ref{ch:xai}).
    \item Qualitative findings that post-hoc explanations, properly presented, can make useful ex-post DSTs (Chapter \ref{ch:xai}).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Plagiarism}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An evaluation of GenAI detectors GPTZero and Originality.ai on Rise's 2022 and 2023 application data (Chapter \ref{ch:genai}).
    \item The Decision Matrix framework for evaluating the suitability of AI systems as support tools for differing decision points.
    \item A case study using GPTZero to support two decision points facing Rise (Chapter \ref{ch:genai}).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Diversity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Diversity Triangle, categorising diversity-related themes according to our three definitions of diversity uncovered through inductive thematic analysis (Chapter \ref{ch:diversity}).
    \item Six design prototypes developed through PD for supporting the diversity needs of a given organisation (Chapter \ref{ch:diversity}).
    \item Design recommendations grounded in PD for system implementers supporting the diversity needs of a given organisation (Chapter \ref{ch:diversity}).
    \item A field deployment of Prototype \ref{fig:diversity} to the Rise selection process selecting $500$ finalists from a pool of $2000$ demonstrating the efficacy of this prototype in practice (Chapter \ref{ch:spf}).
    \item A demonstration of a hypothetical application of Prototype \ref{fig:diversity} as an ex-post DST (Chapter \ref{ch:spf}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Structure}
Chapter \ref{ch:context} serves as an extended introduction and background chapter, including situating this thesis in related work. Following this, Chapter \ref{ch:methods} explores the paradigms that guide research design throughout this thesis, lists methods used throughout the thesis, and ties these methods to specific chapters.

Chapter \ref{ch:xai} responds to common criticisms of post-hoc XAI and explores this approach as a scholarship selection DST via PD workshops with selectors from Rise. Chapter \ref{ch:genai} engages selectors from Rise in an AR process and explores the role of generative AI in selection decisions. Chapter \ref{ch:diversity} engages selectors from both Rise and Ellison Scholars in participatory design to explore selector notions of diversity and potential ways to support these considerations; this chapter ultimately develops 6 design prototypes. Chapter \ref{ch:spf} implements one of these prototypes in a field deployment with Rise, evaluates that deployment, and explores other applications of the technology.

Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} discusses the scope of the thesis, including references to critical theory work falling outside the scope; the SOAI paradigm; design recommendations that developers can use to follow SOAI; methodological and technical limitations of the work herein; and this thesis's broader significance in a quickly changing landscape.
