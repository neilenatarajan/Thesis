Methods We gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated. Results All ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8\% correctly followed the specific journal’s formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98\% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02\% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100\% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68\% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14\% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing. Conclusion ChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.}

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).}

	abstract     = {To detect the deployment of large language models for malicious use cases (e.g., fake content creation or academic plagiarism), several approaches have recently been proposed for identifying AI-generated text via watermarks or statistical irregularities. How robust are these detection algorithms to paraphrases of AI-generated text? To stress test these detectors, we first train an 11B parameter paraphrase generation model (DIPPER) that can paraphrase paragraphs, optionally leveraging surrounding text (e.g., user-written prompts) as context. DIPPER also uses scalar knobs to control the amount of lexical diversity and reordering in the paraphrases. Paraphrasing text generated by three large language models (including GPT3.5-davinci-003) with DIPPER successfully evades several detectors, including watermarking, GPTZero, DetectGPT, and OpenAI's text classifier. For example, DIPPER drops the detection accuracy of DetectGPT from 70.3\% to 4.6\% (at a constant false positive rate of 1\%), without appreciably modifying the input semantics. To increase the robustness of AI-generated text detection to paraphrase attacks, we introduce a simple defense that relies on retrieving semantically-similar generations and must be maintained by a language model API provider. Given a candidate text, our algorithm searches a database of sequences previously generated by the API, looking for sequences that match the candidate text within a certain threshold. We empirically verify our defense using a database of 15M generations from a fine-tuned T5-XXL model and find that it can detect 80\% to 97\% of paraphrased generations across different settings, while only classifying 1\% of human-written sequences as AI-generated. We will open source our code, model and data for future research.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the concern that computers will dehumanize education, one aspect of the general concern over possible threats to social and ethical values resulting from the computerization of schools. Concern over computerization of schools has become a battleground for ideological debates. Our paper does not enter this fray. Rather, we devise an alternative approach, called a grounded analysis, which addresses core concerns of practicing educators and administrators in their own terms. First we examine what people seem to mean when they worry that computers may dehumanize education. We identify four versions of this concern: that children may withdraw from people and society; that the teacher-student relationship may break down; that the teaching of important values may be jeopardized; and that education may become overly standardized. We systematically evaluate each of these concerns. Reaching no simple conclusion, we find that although dehumanization is not an inevitable consequence of using computers in education, it does pose some genuine risks serious enough to justify caution. Importantly, our analysis suggests that the actions of educators and policy makers may significantly raise or lower these risks.}

	abstract     = {Recent advancements in pre-trained language models have enabled convenient methods for generating human-like text at a large scale. Though these generation capabilities hold great potential for breakthrough applications, it can also be a tool for an adversary to generate misinformation. In particular, social media platforms like Twitter are highly susceptible to AI-generated misinformation. A potential threat scenario is when an adversary hijacks a credible user account and incorporates a natural language generator to generate misinformation. Such threats necessitate automated detectors for AI-generated tweets in a given user's Twitter timeline. However, tweets are inherently short, thus making it difficult for current state-of-the-art pre-trained language model-based detectors to accurately detect at what point the AI starts to generate tweets in a given Twitter timeline. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm using stylometric signals to aid detecting AI-generated tweets. We propose models corresponding to quantifying stylistic changes in human and AI tweets in two related tasks: Task 1 - discriminate between human and AI-generated tweets, and Task 2 - detect if and when an AI starts to generate tweets in a given Twitter timeline. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the stylometric features are effective in augmenting the state-of-the-art AI-generated text detectors.},

	abstract     = {The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made them capable of performing astonishingly well on various tasks including document completion and question answering. The unregulated use of these models, however, can potentially lead to malicious consequences such as plagiarism, generating fake news, spamming, etc. Therefore, reliable detection of AI-generated text can be critical to ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recent works attempt to tackle this problem either using certain model signatures present in the generated text outputs or by applying watermarking techniques that imprint specific patterns onto them. In this paper, both empirically and theoretically, we show that these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios. Empirically, we show that paraphrasing attacks, where a light paraphraser is applied on top of the generative text model, can break a whole range of detectors, including the ones using the watermarking schemes as well as neural network-based detectors and zero-shot classifiers. We then provide a theoretical impossibility result indicating that for a sufficiently good language model, even the best-possible detector can only perform marginally better than a random classifier. Finally, we show that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes can be vulnerable against spoofing attacks where adversarial humans can infer hidden watermarking signatures and add them to their generated text to be detected as text generated by the LLMs, potentially causing reputational damages to their developers. We believe these results can open an honest conversation in the community regarding the ethical and reliable use of AI-generated text.},

While existing approaches focus on explaining machine predictions with real-time assistance, we explore model-driven tutorials to help humans understand these patterns in a training phase. We consider both tutorials with guidelines from scientific papers, analogous to current practices of science communication, and automatically selected examples from training data with explanations. We use deceptive review detection as a testbed and conduct large-scale, randomized human-subject experiments to examine the effectiveness of such tutorials. We find that tutorials indeed improve human performance, with and without real-time assistance. In particular, although deep learning provides superior predictive performance than simple models, tutorials and explanations from simple models are more useful to humans. Our work suggests future directions for human-centered tutorials and explanations towards a synergy between humans and AI.}

Current approaches for solving this problem include model explanation, outcome explanation as well as model inspection. While these techniques can be beneficial by providing interpretability, they can be used in a negative manner to perform fairwashing, which we define as promoting the false perception that a machine learning model respects some ethical values. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to systematically rationalize decisions taken by an unfair black-box model using the model explanation as well as the outcome explanation approaches with a given fairness metric. Our solution, LaundryML, is based on a regularized rule list enumeration algorithm whose objective is to search for fair rule lists approximating an unfair black-box model. We empirically evaluate our rationalization technique on black-box models trained on real-world datasets and show that one can obtain rule lists with high fidelity to the black-box model while being considerably less unfair at the same time.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

		Researching a topic and generating an academic paper is a nuanced skill. It can take months or years to produce and publish one, if it is ever published at all. What if there were a way to make this happen instantly? Artificial intelligence (AI) may hold a flame to quickly analyse a research topic and generate an academic paper. There are many forms of AI; this editorial discusses natural language model-based AI, such as ChatGPT, and their potential ability to generate academic papers.

		Natural language model-based AI, in particular ChatGPT, is generating new content and a lot of controversies. This AI software is innovative. It generates, de novo, content that has a natural conversational flow. It can quickly answer questions and write poems, fan fiction and children’s books.1 ChatGPT has even passed the United States Medical Licensing Examination theory section with no additional training and/or years of studying medicine.2

		Language-based AI has already entered the scientific community. Nature reported that four manuscripts in preprint credit ChatGPT as an author.3 Also, an article reported that AI had been used to generate an academic paper.4

		In this editorial, we discuss the pros and cons of AI for manuscript generation in sports and exercise medicine (SEM), generate an academic paper using AI and bypass AI-generation detection, and discuss potential concerns regarding natural language model-based AI. We aim to get insights on how AI, in particular ChatGPT and similar language model-based AI, will impact the future of manuscript generation in SEM. To achieve such purpose, we ought to consider what is an academic paper, whether AI should write academic papers, what the issues are, what our stance should be on AI-generated texts and how we deal with them.

		An academic paper has a thesis and aims to persuade readers of …

Finally, we investigate the robustness of RLHF training, and identify a roughly linear relation between the RL reward and the square root of the KL divergence between the policy and its initialization.

We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.},

We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI’s recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?},

	abstract     = {Government agencies are embracing machine learning to support a variety of resource allocation decisions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, has engaged academic research labs to test the use of machine learning in support of an important national initiative to reduce Clean Water Act violations. We evaluate prototypical risk prediction models that can support compliance interventions and demonstrate how critical algorithmic design choices can generate or mitigate disparate impact in environmental enforcement. First, we show that the definition of which facilities to focus on through this national compliance initiative hinges on arbitrary differences in state-level permitting schemes, causing a shift in environmental protection away from areas with more minority populations. Second, the policy objective to reduce the noncompliance rate is encoded in a classification model, which does not account for the extent of pollution beyond the permitted limit. We hence compare allocation schemes between regression and classification, and show that the latter directs attention towards facilities in more rural and white areas. Overall, our study illustrates that as machine learning enters government, algorithmic design can both embed and elucidate sources of administrative policy discretion with discernable distributional consequences.},

Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.},

Many technical research papers assume that both are important, but conflicting, and propose ways to minimise the trade-offs between these measures. This paper argues that this apparent conflict is based on a misconception. It draws on theoretical discussions from within the fair machine learning research, and from political and legal philosophy, to argue that individual and group fairness are not fundamentally in conflict. First, it outlines accounts of egalitarian fairness which encompass plausible motivations for both group and individual fairness, thereby suggesting that there need be no conflict in principle. Second, it considers the concept of individual justice, from legal philosophy and jurisprudence which seems similar but actually contradicts the notion of individual fairness as proposed in the fair machine learning literature. The conclusion is that the apparent conflict between individual and group fairness is more of an artifact of the blunt application of fairness measures, rather than a matter of conflicting principles. In practice, this conflict may be resolved by a nuanced consideration of the sources of `unfairness' in a particular deployment context, and the carefully justified application of measures to mitigate it.},

This article argues that this notion of individual justice can only be meaningfully served through human judgment. It distinguishes individual justice and considers how it relates to other dimensions of justice, namely consistency and fairness / nondiscrimination. Finally, it identifies and discussess two challenges: first, how individual justice can be accommodated alongside other dimensions of justice in the socio-technical contexts of humans-in-the-loop; and second, how inequities in individual justice may result from an uneven application of human judgment in algorithmic contexts.},

In this paper, we will develop a new algorithm, batch active preference-based learning, that enables efficient learning of reward functions using as few data samples as possible while still having short query generation times. We introduce several approximations to the batch active learning problem, and provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we present our experimental results for a variety of robotics tasks in simulation. Our results suggest that our batch active learning algorithm requires only a few queries that are computed in a short amount of time. We then showcase our algorithm in a study to learn human users' preferences.},

In using TA, researchers must choose between a diverse range of approaches that can differ considerably in their underlying (but often implicit) conceptualizations of qualitative research, meaningful knowledge production, and key constructs such as themes, as well as analytic procedures. This diversity within the method of TA is typically poorly understood and rarely acknowledged, resulting in the frequent publication of research lacking in design coherence. Furthermore, because TA offers researchers something closer to a method (a transtheoretical tool or technique) rather than a methodology (a theoretically informed framework for research), one with considerable theoretical and design flexibility, researchers need to engage in careful conceptual and design thinking to produce TA research with methodological integrity. In this article, we support researchers in their conceptual and design thinking for TA, and particularly for the reflexive approach we have developed, by guiding them through the conceptual underpinnings of different approaches to TA, and key design considerations. We outline our typology of three main “schools” of TA—coding reliability, codebook, and reflexive—and consider how these differ in their conceptual underpinnings, with a particular focus on the distinct characteristics of our reflexive approach. We discuss key areas of design—research questions, data collection, participant/data item selection strategy and criteria, ethics, and quality standards and practices—and end with guidance on reporting standards for reflexive TA.

Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

Our study extends beyond the traditional scope of the white box paradox by proposing a framework for examining explanation inadequacy. We specifically investigate how accurate AI advice, when paired with misleading explanations, affects decision-making in logic puzzle tasks. Our findings introduce the concept of the ‘XAI halo effect,’ where participants were influenced by the misleading explanations to the extent that they did not verify the correctness of the advice, despite its accuracy. This effect reveals a nuanced challenge in XAI, where even correct advice can lead to misjudgment if the accompanying explanations are not coherent and contextually relevant. The study highlights the critical need for explanations to be both accurate and relevant, especially in contexts where decision accuracy is paramount. This calls into question the use of explanations in situations where their potential to mislead outweighs their transparency or educational value.},

We show that, in certain cases, there exist at least two ground-truth feature-based explanations, and that, sometimes, neither of them is enough to provide a complete view of the decision-making process of the model. Moreover, we show that two popular classes of explainers, Shapley explainers and minimal sufficient subsets explainers, target fundamentally different types of ground-truth explanations, despite the apparently implicit assumption that explainers should look for one specific feature-based explanation.

		Abstract

		Dimensionality reduction is standard practice for filtering noise and identifying relevant dimensions in large-scale data analyses. In biology, single-cell expression studies almost always begin with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce ‘all-in-one’ visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell relationships. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice. We examine the theoretical and practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data, and find extensive distortions incurred on the global and local properties of biological patterns relative to the high-dimensional, ambient space. In lieu of this, we propose semi-supervised dimension reduction to higher dimension, and show that such targeted reduction guided by the metadata associated with single-cell experiments provides useful latent space representations for hypothesis-driven biological discovery.

However, empirical studies have found mixed and even negative results. An open question, therefore, is under what conditions explanations can improve human understanding and in what way. Using adapted causal diagrams, we provide a formal characterization of the interplay between machine explanations and human understanding, and show how human intuitions play a central role in enabling human understanding. Specifically, we identify three core concepts of interest that cover all existing quantitative measures of understanding in the context of human-AI decision making: task decision boundary, model decision boundary, and model error. Our key result is that without assumptions about task-specific intuitions, explanations may potentially improve human understanding of model decision boundary, but they cannot improve human understanding of task decision boundary or model error. To achieve complementary human-AI performance, we articulate possible ways on how explanations need to work with human intuitions. For instance, human intuitions about the relevance of features (e.g., education is more important than age in predicting a person's income) can be critical in detecting model error. We validate the importance of human intuitions in shaping the outcome of machine explanations with empirical human-subject studies. Overall, our work provides a general framework along with actionable implications for future algorithmic development and empirical experiments of machine explanations.},

	abstract     = {Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human-level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations.

	abstract     = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

The results suggest that although different justice dimensions are moderately to highly related, they contribute incremental variance explained in fairness perceptions. The results also illustrate the overall and unique relationships among distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice and several organizational outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, evaluation of authority, organizational citizenship behavior, withdrawal, performance).

	abstract     = {Background Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site. ResultsThe OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500 km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94\% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95–97\%. The CCQ was 85\%, 85\% and 71\% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55\% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO2 flux which was 19\% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands. Conclusions The OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from “wetlands drainage and rewetting”. The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios. However, the OBIA method is robust and accurate and could be used to assess the extent of drains in peatlands across the globe aiding the refinement of peatland carbon dynamics .},

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy. We conclude by identifying the European Union as being especially well-placed to play a leading role in this policy response and provide 13 recommendations that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing its impact on the environment.},

Findings The authors coin this tension as the “exclusion-inclusion paradox,” highlighting that TM and DM reflect contradictory, yet interrelated principles: organizations promote exclusion through a TM architecture that focuses on the identification and development of a few selected employees, while simultaneously, organizations promote inclusion, in the attempt to minimize existing inequalities for traditionally marginalized groups. Practical implications Once uncovered, the exclusion-inclusion paradox enables organizational actors to make choices on whether to respond actively or defensively to the paradox. The authors argue for active responses in order to work through the paradox. Originality/value This is the first paper adopting a paradox lens in order to interweave the DM literature with TM literature in the attempt to explain how DM and TM constitute contradicting yet interrelated principles.},

Though the software implementation of GPT-3 is still in its initial beta release phase, and its full capabilities are still unknown as of the time of this writing, it has been shown that this artificial intelligence can comprehend prompts in natural language, on virtually any topic, and generate relevant original text content that is indistinguishable from human writing.

This paper presents examples of original content generated by the author using GPT-3. These examples illustrate some of the capabilities of GPT-3 in comprehending prompts in natural language and generating convincing content in response.

We explored these questions in a multi-method field study of a large multinational fashion organization. We first conducted a quantitative field experiment to compare the use of two models—an interpretable versus an uninterpretable algorithmic model— designed to assist employees with decision making around how many products to send to each of its stores. Contrary to what the literature on interpretable algorithms would lead us to expect, under conditions of high perceived uncertainty, decision makers’ use of an uninterpretable algorithmic model was associated with higher acceptance of algorithmic recommendations and higher task performance than was their use of an interpretable algorithmic model with a similar level of performance. We next investigated this puzzling result using 31 interviews with 14 employees—2 algorithm developers, 2 managers, and 10 decision makers. We advance two concepts that suggest a refinement of theory on interpretable algorithms. First, overconfident troubleshooting—a decision maker rejecting a recommendation coming from an interpretable algorithm, because of their belief that they understand the inner workings of complex processes better than they actually do. Second, social proofing the algorithm—including respected peers in the algorithm development and testing process—may make it more likely that decision makers accept recommendations coming from an uninterpretable algorithm in situations characterized by high perceived uncertainty, because the decision makers may seek to reduce their uncertainty by incorporating the opinions of people with their own knowledge base and experience.},

These models can potentially deceive by generating artificial text that appears to be human-generated. This issue is particularly significant in domains such as law, education, and science, where ensuring the integrity of text is of the utmost importance. This survey provides an overview of the current approaches employed to differentiate between texts generated by humans and ChatGPT.

In this paper, we develop a social justice orientation to designing for such challenges. We highlight a breadth of design strategies that target the goals of social justice along six dimensions – transformation, recognition, reciprocity, enablement, distribution, and accountability – and elaborate three commitments necessary to developing a social justice oriented design practice – a commitment to conflict, a commitment to reflexivity, and a commitment to personal ethics and politics. Although there are no easy solutions to systemic social issues, a social justice orientation provides one way to foster an engagement with the thorny political issues that are increasingly acknowledged as crucial to a field that is not just about technological possibility, but also about political responsibility.},

In this work we present RAID: the largest and most challenging benchmark dataset for machine-generated text detection. RAID includes over 6 million generations spanning 11 models, 8 domains, 11 adversarial attacks and 4 decoding strategies. Using RAID, we evaluate the out-of-domain and adversarial robustness of 8 open- and 4 closed-source detectors and find that current detectors are easily fooled by adversarial attacks, variations in sampling strategies, repetition penalties, and unseen generative models.

		Within creativity research, interest and capability in utilizing text-mining models to quantify the Originality of participant responses to Divergent Thinking tasks has risen sharply over the last decade, with many extant studies fruitfully using such methods to uncover substantive patterns among creativity-relevant constructs. However, no systematic psychometric investigation of the reliability and validity of human-rated Originality scores, and scores from various freely available text-mining systems, exists in the literature. Here we conduct such an investigation with the Alternate Uses Task. We demonstrate that, despite their inherent subjectivity, human-rated Originality scores displayed the highest reliability at both the composite and latent factor levels. However, the text-mining system GloVe 840B was highly capable of approximating human-rated scores both in its measurement properties and its correlations to various creativity-related criteria including ideational Fluency, Elaboration, Openness, Intellect, and self-reported Creative Activities. We conclude that, in conjunction with other salient indicators of creative potential, text-mining models (and especially the GloVe 840B system) are capable of supporting reliable and valid inferences about Divergent Thinking.

		An open access system for producing the Originality scores that were psychometrically examined in this paper is available for free at our website: https://openscoring.du.edu/.

We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve the complementary goal of "fair affirmative action," which guarantees statistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving any classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying population), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible. Finally, we discuss the relationship of fairness to privacy: when fairness implies privacy, and how tools developed in the context of differential privacy may be applied to fairness.},

Three studies were performed with Cameron University students to explore the relationship among automation reliability, trust, and reliance. With the assistance of an automated decision aid, participants viewed slides of Fort Sill terrain and indicated the presence or absence of a camouflaged soldier. Results from the three studies indicate that trust is an important factor in understanding automation reliance decisions. Participants initially considered the automated decision aid trustworthy and reliable. After observing the automated aid make errors, participants distrusted even reliable aids, unless an explanation was provided regarding why the aid might err. Knowing why the aid might err increased trust in the decision aid and increased automation reliance, even when the trust was unwarranted. Our studies suggest a need for future research focused on understanding automation use, examining individual differences in automation reliance, and developing valid and reliable self-report measures of trust in automation.},

The proposed system extracts a set of objective criteria from the applicants' LinkedIn profile, and infers their personality characteristics using linguistic analysis on their blog posts. Our system was found to perform consistently compared to human recruiters; thus, it can be trusted for the automation of applicant ranking and personality mining.},

In this paper, we show—arguably, surprisingly—that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called RepeatedGreedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. RepeatedGreedy achieves $(1 + O(1/sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nrsqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only textitonce and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called SampleGreedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). SampleGreedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of RepeatedGreedy and SampleGreedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while SampleGreedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.},

The random process for selecting this panel should satisfy two properties. First, it must produce a panel that is representative of the population. Second, in the spirit of democratic equality, individuals would ideally be selected to serve on this panel with equal probability2,3. However, in practice these desiderata are in tension owing to differential participation rates across subpopulations4,5. Here we apply ideas from fair division to develop selection algorithms that satisfy the two desiderata simultaneously to the greatest possible extent: our selection algorithms choose representative panels while selecting individuals with probabilities as close to equal as mathematically possible, for many metrics of ‘closeness to equality’. Our implementation of one such algorithm has already been used to select more than 40 citizens’ assemblies around the world. As we demonstrate using data from ten citizens’ assemblies, adopting our algorithm over a benchmark representing the previous state of the art leads to substantially fairer selection probabilities. By contributing a fairer, more principled and deployable algorithm, our work puts the practice of sortition on firmer foundations. Moreover, our work establishes citizens’ assemblies as a domain in which insights from the field of fair division can lead to high-impact applications.},

This comparison is typically achieved by a basic subjective assessment of the observed difference in accuracy but should be undertaken in a statistically rigorous fashion. One approach for the evaluation of the statistical significance of a difference in map accuracy that has been widely used in remote sensing research is based on the comparison of the kappa coefficient of agreement derived for each map. The conventional approach to the comparison of kappa coefficients assumes that the samples used in their calculation are independent, an assumption that is commonly unsatisfied because the same sample of ground data sites is often used for each map. Alternative methods to evaluate the statistical significance of differences in accuracy are available for both related and independent samples. Approaches for map comparison based on the kappa coefficient and proportion of correctly allocated cases, the two most widely used metrics of thematic map accuracy in remote sensing, are discussed. An example illustrates how classifications based on the same sample of ground data sites may be compared rigorously and highlights the importance of distinguishing between one- and two-sided statistical tests in the comparison of classification accuracy statements.},

At the same time, there is evidence of increasing employment of US questionnaires in firms as a measure of system effectiveness. Yet there is surprisingly little information systems research linking user satisfaction with user behavior. In this study, measures of user satisfaction and system affected behavior are taken for an indirect and a direct user group of the same information system in 39 organizations.

AR has evolved over the last several decades and offers HCI researchers theoretical lenses, methodological approaches, and pragmatic guidance for conducting socially relevant, collaborative, and engaged research.

This article is an attempt to establish individual assessment's place in the history of personnel selection, and to examine why the practice has survived despite receiving little attention in research and graduate training. It is argued that the clinical, holistic approach that has characterized individual-assessment practice has survived primarily because the “elementalistic” testing approach, focusing on traits and abilities, has often been dismissed as inadequate for addressing the complexities of the executive profile. Moreover, public displeasure with standard paper-and-pencil testing in the 1960s and 1970s made the holistic approach to assessment an attractive, alternative. The article contrasts individual assessment practice with the current state of knowledge on psychological assessment and personnel decision making. Like psychotherapy in the 1950s, individual psychological assessment appears to have achieved the status of functional autonomy within psychology.}

Understanding these beliefs is just as important as understanding organizational constraints to the adoption of selection technologies and may be more useful for informing the design of successful interventions. One of these is the implicit belief that it is theoretically possible to achieve near-perfect precision in predicting performance on the job. That is, people have an inherent resistance to analytical approaches to selection because they fail to view selection as probabilistic and subject to error. Another is the implicit belief that prediction of human behavior is improved through experience. This myth of expertise results in an overreliance on intuition and a reluctance to undermine one’s own credibility by using a selection decision aid.}

Michigan adopted a policy of holistically reviewing undergraduate applications in 2003, after the US Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional its points-based admissions policy. Using archival and ethnographic data, we trace the adoption, evolution, and undoing of Michigan’s quantified system of admissions decision-making between 1964 and 2004. In a context in which opponents of the system had legal avenues to engage a powerful outside authority, we argue that three internal features of the University’s quantified admissions policy contributed to its demise: its transparency, the instability of the categories it quantified, and the existence of qualitative alternatives. Our analysis challenges the presumed durability and inevitability of quantification by identifying its vulnerabilities and suggests that quantification should be understood as a matter of degree rather than a simple binary.},

	abstract     = {Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from serving as a writing aid to informing hiring decisions. Yet these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgments biased in problematic ways about groups like African Americans. While prior research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice: we extend research showing that Americans hold raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English and find that language models have the same prejudice, exhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement. By contrast, the language models' overt stereotypes about African Americans are much more positive. We demonstrate that dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences by asking language models to make hypothetical decisions about people, based only on how they speak. Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that existing methods for alleviating racial bias in language models such as human feedback training do not mitigate the dialect prejudice, but can exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by teaching language models to superficially conceal the racism that they maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe employment of language technology.},

The results of this study show that applicants perceive AI technology positively in hiring processes and see it as useful and easy to use. In terms of advantages, reduced response time was recognized as the most significant benefit. The lack of nuance in human judgment, low accuracy and reliability, and immature technology were identified as the biggest drawbacks of AI in recruitment.},

	abstract     = {Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, and choosing speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect the selection of any particular candidate, and, thereby the composition of the final cohort. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, entrofy, designed to be part of a human-in-the-loop decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just, transparent, and accountable as possible. We suggest embedding entrofy in a two-step selection procedure. During a merit review, the committee selects all applicants, submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool via a new algorithm and software tool called entrofy. entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include academic discipline, home country, experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable characteristics. The entrofy algorithm then yields the approximation of pre-defined target proportions for each category by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show how entrofy selects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study of Astro Hack Week. This two stage candidate and cohort selection process allows human judgment and debate to guide the assessment of candidates’ merit in step 1. Then the human committee defines relevant diversity criteria which will be used as computational parameters in entrofy. Once the parameters are defined, the set of candidates who meet the minimum threshold for merit are passed through the entrofy cohort selection procedure in step 2 which yields a cohort of a composition as close as possible to the computational parameters defined by the committee. This process has the benefit of separating the meritorious assessment of candidates from certain elements of their diversity and from some considerations around cohort composition. It also increases the transparency and auditability of the process, which enables, but does not guarantee, fairness. Splitting merit and diversity considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected, though it does not eliminate the possibility of objectionable bias.},

In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of how choices such as sampling strategy and text excerpt length can impact the performance of automatic detection methods as well as human raters. We find that the sampling strategies which result in more human-like text according to human raters create distributional differences from human-written text that make detection easy for automatic discriminators.}

One approach to specifying complex goals asks humans to judge during training which agent behaviors are safe and useful, but this approach can fail if the task is too complicated for a human to directly judge. To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions about the meaning of AI alignment. We report results on an initial MNIST experiment where agents compete to convince a sparse classifier, boosting the classifier's accuracy from 59.4\% to 88.9\% given 6 pixels and from 48.2\% to 85.2\% given 4 pixels. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the debate model, focusing on potential weaknesses as the model scales up, and we propose future human and computer experiments to test these properties.},

We used a within-subject factorial experiment to present 220 clinicians with patient vignettes, each with or without a machine-learning (ML) recommendation and one of the multiple forms of explanation. We found that interacting with ML recommendations did not significantly improve clinicians’ treatment selection accuracy, assessed as concordance with expert psychopharmacologist consensus, compared to baseline scenarios in which clinicians made treatment decisions independently. Interacting with incorrect recommendations paired with explanations that included limited but easily interpretable information did lead to a significant reduction in treatment selection accuracy compared to baseline questions. These results suggest that incorrect ML recommendations may adversely impact clinician treatment selections and that explanations are insufficient for addressing overreliance on imperfect ML algorithms. More generally, our findings challenge the common assumption that clinicians interacting with ML tools will perform better than either clinicians or ML algorithms individually.},

What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.},

To provide a more proactive and pragmatic perspective, this article highlights the complementarity of humans and AI and examines how each can bring their own strength in organizational decision-making processes typically characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and equivocality. With a greater computational information processing capacity and an analytical approach, AI can extend humans’ cognition when addressing complexity, whereas humans can still offer a more holistic, intuitive approach in dealing with uncertainty and equivocality in organizational decision making. This premise mirrors the idea of intelligence augmentation, which states that AI systems should be designed with the intention of augmenting, not replacing, human contributions.},

Unfortunately, Indian speakers find a very poor representation in existing English ASR benchmarks such as LibriSpeech, Switchboard, Speech Accent Archive, etc. In this work, we address this gap by creating Svarah, a benchmark that contains 9.6 hours of transcribed English audio from 117 speakers across 65 geographic locations throughout India, resulting in a diverse range of accents. Svarah comprises both read speech and spontaneous conversational data, covering various domains, such as history, culture, tourism, etc., ensuring a diverse vocabulary. We evaluate 6 open source ASR models and 2 commercial ASR systems on Svarah and show that there is clear scope for improvement on Indian accents. Svarah as well as all our code will be publicly available.},

To this end, logit multilevel models and a novel graphic analysis were used. Our findings suggest that the stratification criteria currently used in Medellin should be revised. The socio-economic strata, which only considers the characteristics of the dwellings, streets and surrounding areas, explain approximately one tenth of the variability in self-reported quality of life. When other economic and non-economic factors are considered, a different strata ranking for guiding public policies than that used in Medellin was estimated. Neighbourhood safety and personal safety are key drivers of quality of life, whereas higher consumption expenditure is most effective in the most disadvantaged strata.}

	abstract     = {Daniel Kahneman, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is one of the world's most important thinkers. His ideas have had a profound impact on many fields - including business, medicine, and politics - but until now, he has never brought together his many years of research in one book. In "Thinking, Fast and Slow", Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and make choices. One system is fast, intuitive, and emotional; the other is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities - and also the faults and biases - of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. The importance of properly framing risks, the effects of cognitive biases on how we view others, the dangers of prediction, the right ways to develop skills, the pros and cons of fear and optimism, the difference between our experience and memory of events, the real components of happiness - each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions. Drawing on a lifetime's experimental experience, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our professional and our personal lives-and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. "Thinking, Fast and Slow" will transform the way you take decisions and experience the world.}

The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments9. We built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest and random-experiment selection.},

	abstract     = {The release of openly available, robust natural language generation algorithms (NLG) has spurred much public attention and debate. One reason lies in the algorithms' purported ability to generate humanlike text across various domains. Empirical evidence using incentivized tasks to assess whether people (a) can distinguish and (b) prefer algorithm-generated versus human-written text is lacking. We conducted two experiments assessing behavioral reactions to the state-of-the-art Natural Language Generation algorithm GPT-2 (Ntotal = 830). Using the identical starting lines of human poems, GPT-2 produced samples of poems. From these samples, either a random poem was chosen (Human-out-of-theloop) or the best one was selected (Human-in-the-loop) and in turn matched with a human-written poem. In a new incentivized version of the Turing Test, participants failed to reliably detect the algorithmicallygenerated poems in the Human-in-the-loop treatment, yet succeeded in the Human-out-of-the-loop treatment. Further, people reveal a slight aversion to algorithm-generated poetry, independent on whether participants were informed about the algorithmic origin of the poem (Transparency) or not (Opacity). We discuss what these results convey about the performance of NLG algorithms to produce human-like text and propose methodologies to study such learning algorithms in human-agent experimental settings.},

As part of human resource management (HRM), talent acquisition covers recruitment and team-assembly activities and is allegedly in dire need for digital aid. We analyze the pitfalls and tensions of digitalization in this area through a lens that builds on the interdisciplinary literature related to digital ethics. Using three relevant landmark papers, we analyzed qualitative data from 47 interviews of HRM professionals in Finland, including team-assembly facilitators and recruitment experts. The analysis highlights 14 potential tensions and pitfalls, such as the tension between requesting detailed data versus respecting privacy and the pitfall of unequal treatment across application channels. We identify that the values of autonomy, fairness and utility are often especially at risk of being compromised. We discuss the tendency of the binary considerations related to human and automated decision making, and the reasons for the incompatibility between current digital systems and organizations’ needs for talent acquisition.},

However, there is little to no research that provides answers to these critical questions. In this work, we introduce and study the disagreement problem in explainable machine learning. More specifically, we formalize the notion of disagreement between explanations, analyze how often such disagreements occur in practice, and how do practitioners resolve these disagreements. To this end, we first conduct interviews with data scientists to understand what constitutes disagreement between explanations generated by different methods for the same model prediction, and introduce a novel quantitative framework to formalize this understanding. We then leverage this framework to carry out a rigorous empirical analysis with four real-world datasets, six state-of-the-art post hoc explanation methods, and eight different predictive models, to measure the extent of disagreement between the explanations generated by various popular explanation methods. In addition, we carry out an online user study with data scientists to understand how they resolve the aforementioned disagreements. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art explanation methods often disagree in terms of the explanations they output. Our findings also underscore the importance of developing principled evaluation metrics that enable practitioners to effectively compare explanations.},

This discursive commodification is marked by a decreasing emphasis on trust understood as the expected reliability of a trusted agent, and increased emphasis on instrumental and extractive framings of trust as a resource. This tendency, we argue, does an ultimate disservice to developers, users, and systems alike, insofar as it obscures the subtle mechanisms through which trust in AI systems might be built, making it less likely that it will be.},

Justification for these methods rests on two pillars: their desirable mathematical properties, and their applicability to specific motivations for explanations. We show that mathematical problems arise when Shapley values are used for feature importance and that the solutions to mitigate these necessarily induce further complexity, such as the need for causal reasoning. We also draw on additional literature to argue that Shapley values do not provide explanations which suit human-centric goals of explainability.},

There was consistent and substantial loss of validity when data were combined holistically--even by experts who are knowledgeable about the jobs and organizations in question--across multiple criteria in work and academic settings.

Although machine learning models can sometimes achieve impressive performance in these tasks, these tasks are not amenable to full automation. To realize the potential of machine learning for improving human decisions, it is important to understand how assistance from machine learning models affects human performance and human agency. In this paper, we use deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. We propose a spectrum between full human agency and full automation, and develop varying levels of machine assistance along the spectrum that gradually increase the influence of machine predictions. We find that without showing predicted labels, explanations alone slightly improve human performance in the end task. In comparison, human performance is greatly improved by showing predicted labels ({\textgreater}20\% relative improvement) and can be further improved by explicitly suggesting strong machine performance. Interestingly, when predicted labels are shown, explanations of machine predictions induce a similar level of accuracy as an explicit statement of strong machine performance. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between human performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predictions can moderate this tradeoff.},

Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including data centers and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many important scientific milestones are achieved thanks to the development of high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to contextualize GHG emissions are defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms (www.green-algorithms.org) is developed, which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of hardware configurations. Finally, the GHG emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary CO2 emissions, the authors hope to raise awareness and facilitate greener computation.},

We found that the importance of clarifying position requirements and assessing candidates as “whole individuals” are commonly discussed by both recruiters and job seekers. In contrast, while recruiters tended to be more aware of cognitive bias and desired more tool support during interviews, job seekers voiced more desire towards a healthy candidate-company relationship. Additionally, both roles considered the uncertainty of the current technology capability and reduced human contact as concerns for using automated tools.

Ethnography refers to the use of in-depth observation, and often participation, of a human group, culture, or context, with the goal of developing a rich description of activities, interactions, beliefs, roles, and goals. Ethnographic research in human-computer interaction (HCI) is particularly useful for understanding environment where stakeholders interact to complete complex tasks involving the need for coordination and exchange of information. This chapter discusses the selection of sites, identification of research roles, practical issues for ethnographic studies, and processes involved in collecting and analyzing ethnographic data. Examples of ethnographic HCI studies in home, work, education, and other settings are provided.},

This gives rise to the agent alignment problem: how do we create agents that behave in accordance with the user's intentions? We outline a high-level research direction to solve the agent alignment problem centered around reward modeling: learning a reward function from interaction with the user and optimizing the learned reward function with reinforcement learning. We discuss the key challenges we expect to face when scaling reward modeling to complex and general domains, concrete approaches to mitigate these challenges, and ways to establish trust in the resulting agents.},

With the rich application opportunities, explainability is believed to have moved beyond a demand by data scientists or researchers to comprehend the models they develop, to an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI deployed in numerous domains. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are becoming increasingly important. In this chapter, we begin with a high-level overview of the technical landscape of XAI algorithms, then selectively survey our own and other recent HCI works that take human-centered approaches to design, evaluate, and provide conceptual and methodological tools for XAI. We ask the question "what are human-centered approaches doing for XAI" and highlight three roles that they play in shaping XAI technologies by helping navigate, assess and expand the XAI toolbox: to drive technical choices by users' explainability needs, to uncover pitfalls of existing XAI methods and inform new methods, and to provide conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.},

This study conducts a comprehensive survey of morphing aircraft. First, the methods to design the configuration of a morphing aircraft are presented and analyzed. Then, the nonlinear dynamic characteristics and aerodynamic interference caused by a morphing wing are described. Subsequently, the dynamic modeling and flight control methods for solving the flight control problems are summarized with respect to these features. Finally, the general as well as special challenges ahead of the development of intelligent morphing aircraft are discussed. The findings can provide a theoretical and technical reference for designing future morphing aircraft or morphing-wing UAVs.}

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability. In this work, we developed a novel GPT4-enabled de-identification framework ("DeID-GPT") to automatically identify and remove the identifying information. Compared to existing commonly used medical text data de-identification methods, our developed DeID-GPT showed the highest accuracy and remarkable reliability in masking private information from the unstructured medical text while preserving the original structure and meaning of the text. This study is one of the earliest to utilize ChatGPT and GPT-4 for medical text data processing and de-identification, which provides insights for further research and solution development on the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 in healthcare.

This case study sheds light on how to initiate and organize events that build on existing PAR efforts, and what practical challenges might exist in this process. Building on a photovoice research project, we—a collaborative team of university researchers and staff members of a community organization in Eastside Detroit—co-organized a community-based public-facing exhibition that featured community members’ photographic narratives of personal and communal safety and surveillance. In this case study, we reflect on the challenges we experienced in planning and holding the exhibition.

The estimated probabilities are then used in making decisions at the individual level. In the past, there has been controversy about whether the probabilities derived from group-level calculations can meaningfully be applied to individuals. Using Bayesian hierarchical models applied to a large longitudinal dataset from the court system in the state of Kentucky, we analyze variation in individual-level probabilities of failing to appear for court and the extent to which it is captured by covariates. We ﬁnd that individuals within the same risk group vary widely in their probability of the outcome. In practice, this means that allocating individuals to risk groups based on standard approaches to risk assessment, in large part, results in creating distinctions among individuals who are not meaningfully different in terms of their likelihood of the outcome. This is because uncertainty about the probability that any particular individual will fail to appear is large relative to the difference in average probabilities among any reasonable set of risk groups.},

	abstract     = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

This paper attempts a comprehensive, structured overview of the specific conceptual, procedural, and statistical limitations of models in machine learning when applied to society. Machine learning modelers themselves can use the described hierarchy to identify possible failure points and think through how to address them, and consumers of machine learning models can know what to question when confronted with the decision about if, where, and how to apply machine learning. The limitations go from commitments inherent in quantification itself, through to showing how unmodeled dependencies can lead to cross-validation being overly optimistic as a way of assessing model performance.},

	abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to improve the health and well-being of people, but adoption in clinical practice is still limited. Lack of transparency is identified as one of the main barriers to implementation, as clinicians should be confident the AI system can be trusted. Explainable AI has the potential to overcome this issue and can be a step towards trustworthy AI. In this paper we review the recent literature to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners on the design of explainable AI systems for the health-care domain and contribute to formalization of the field of explainable AI. We argue the reason to demand explainability determines what should be explained as this determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability (i.e. interpretability and fidelity). Based on this, we propose a framework to guide the choice between classes of explainable AI methods (explainable modelling versus post-hoc explanation; model-based, attribution-based, or example-based explanations; global and local explanations). Furthermore, we find that quantitative evaluation metrics, which are important for objective standardized evaluation, are still lacking for some properties (e.g. clarity) and types of explanations (e.g. example-based methods). We conclude that explainable modelling can contribute to trustworthy AI, but the benefits of explainability still need to be proven in practice and complementary measures might be needed to create trustworthy AI in health care (e.g. reporting data quality, performing extensive (external) validation, and regulation).},

	abstract     = {Peatlands offer a series of ecosystem services including carbon storage, biomass production, and climate regulation. Climate change and rapid land use change are degrading peatlands, liberating their stored carbon (C) into the atmosphere. To conserve peatlands and help in realising the Paris Agreement, we need to understand their extent, status, and C stocks. However, current peatland knowledge is vague—estimates of global peatland extent ranges from 1 to 4.6 million km2, and C stock estimates vary between 113 and 612 Pg (or billion tonne C). This uncertainty mostly stems from the coarse spatial scale of global soil maps. In addition, most global peatland estimates are based on rough country inventories and reports that use outdated data. This review shows that digital mapping using field observations combined with remotely-sensed images and statistical models is an avenue to more accurately map peatlands and decrease this knowledge gap. We describe peat mapping experiences from 12 countries or regions and review 90 recent studies on peatland mapping. We found that interest in mapping peat information derived from satellite imageries and other digital mapping technologies is growing. Many studies have delineated peat extent using land cover from remote sensing, ecology, and environmental field studies, but rarely perform validation, and calculating the uncertainty of prediction is rare. This paper then reviews various proximal and remote sensing techniques that can be used to map peatlands. These include geophysical measurements (electromagnetic induction, resistivity measurement, and gamma radiometrics), radar sensing (SRTM, SAR), and optical images (Visible and Infrared). Peatland is better mapped when using more than one covariate, such as optical and radar products using nonlinear machine learning algorithms. The proliferation of satellite data available in an open-access format, availability of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment, and high-performance computing facilities could enhance the way peatlands are mapped. Digital soil mapping allows us to map peat in a cost-effective, objective, and accurate manner. Securing peatlands for the future, and abating their contribution to atmospheric C levels, means digitally mapping them now.},

For example, students may use LLMs to complete written assignments, leaving instructors unable to accurately assess student learning. In this paper, we first demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g, T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

	abstract     = {Significance The recent surge in interpretability research has led to confusion on numerous fronts. In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work. , Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.},

The law will also effectively create a “right to explanation,” whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and enable explanation.}, note={arXiv:1606.08813 [cs, stat]}, number={3}, journal={AI Magazine}, author={Goodman, Bryce and Flaxman, Seth}, year={2017}, month=sep, pages={50–57} }

They change the perception of the world, affect our behavior by influencing our choices, and are an important source of social order. Algorithms on the Internet have significant economic implications in newly emerging markets and for existing markets in various sectors. A wide range of our daily activities in general and our media consumption in particular are increasingly shaped by algorithms operating behind the scenes: the selection of online news via search engines and news aggregators, the consumption of music and video entertainment via recommender systems, the choice of services and products in online shops and the selection of status messages displayed on social online networks are the most prominent examples of this omnipresent trend. Algorithms suggest friends, news, songs and travel routes. Moreover, they automatically produce news articles and messages, they calculate scorings of content and people, and are employed to observe our behavior and interests as well as to predict our future needs and actions. By assigning relevance to certain pieces of information they keep consumers, companies and authorities from drowning in a growing flood of information and online data. At the same time, they mine and construct realities, guide our actions and thereby determine the economic success of products and services. Algorithms form the technofunctional basis of new services and business models that economically challenge traditional industries and business strategies. These economic changes and challenges are accompanied by and interact with significant social risks such as manipulation and bias, threats to privacy and violations of intellectual property rights that compromise the economic and social welfare effects of algorithmic selection applications}, number={2710399}, author={Latzer, Michael and Hollnbuchner, Katharina and Just, Natascha and Saurwein, Florian}, year={2014}, month=oct, language={en} }

  abstract = 	 {The most prevalent notions of fairness in machine learning fix a small collection of pre-defined groups (such as race or gender), and then ask for approximate parity of some statistic of the classifier (such as false positive rate) across these groups. Constraints of this form are susceptible to fairness gerrymandering, in which a classifier is fair on each individual group, but badly violates the fairness constraint on structured subgroups, such as certain combinations of protected attribute values. We thus consider fairness across exponentially or infinitely many subgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected attributes. We first prove that the problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false positive rates and statistical parity is computationally equivalent to the problem of weak agnostic learning — which means it is hard in the worst case, even for simple structured subclasses. However, it also suggests that common heuristics for learning can be applied to successfully solve the auditing problem in practice. We then derive an algorithm that provably converges in a polynomial number of steps to the best subgroup-fair distribution over classifiers, given access to an oracle which can solve the agnostic learning problem. The algorithm is based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a zero-sum game between a Learner (the primal player) and an Auditor (the dual player). We implement a variant of this algorithm using heuristic oracles, and show that we can effectively both audit and learn fair classifiers on a real dataset.}

Experiments across professions with varying gender proportions show that balancing gender representation in candidate slates can correct biases for some professions where the world distribution is skewed, although doing so has no impact on other professions where human persistent preferences are at play. We show that the gender of the decision-maker, complexity of the decision-making task and over- and under-representation of genders in the candidate slate can all impact the final decision. By decoupling sources of bias, we can better isolate strategies for bias mitigation in human-in-the-loop systems.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing}, author={Peng, Andi and Nushi, Besmira and Kıcıman, Emre and Inkpen, Kori and Suri, Siddharth and Kamar, Ece}, year={2019}, month={Oct.}, pages={125-134} }

We consider the problem maxS⊂N\{a(S):{\textbar}S{\textbar}≤K,z(S) submodular\}.Several hard combinatorial optimization problems can be posed in this framework. For example, the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a matroid, when the elements of the matroid are colored and the elements of the independent set can have no more thanK colors, is in this class. The uncapacitated location problem is a special case of this matroid optimization problem.We analyze greedy and local improvement heuristics and a linear programming relaxation for this problem. Our results are worst case bounds on the quality of the approximations. For example, whenz(S) is nondecreasing andz(0) = 0, we show that a “greedy” heuristic always produces a solution whose value is at least 1 −[(K − 1)/K]K times the optimal value. This bound can be achieved for eachK and has a limiting value of (e − 1)/e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm.},

We show that maximum margin methods such as boosted trees and boosted stumps push probability mass away from 0 and 1 yielding a characteristic sigmoid shaped distortion in the predicted probabilities. Models such as Naive Bayes, which make unrealistic independence assumptions, push probabilities toward 0 and 1. Other models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective. The empirical results show that after calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict the best probabilities.}

While such technology shows promise, willingness to use and rely on intelligent systems may depend on whether people can trust and understand them. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of explainable interfaces that attempt to help explain why or how a system produced the output for a given input. However, the effects of meaningful and meaningless explanations (determined by their alignment with human logic) are not properly understood, especially with users who are non-experts in data science. Additionally, we wanted to explore how explanation inclusion and level of meaningfulness would affect the user’s perception of accuracy. We designed a controlled experiment using an image classification scenario with local explanations to evaluate and better understand these issues. Our results show that whether explanations are human-meaningful can significantly affect perception of a system’s accuracy independent of the actual accuracy observed from system usage. Participants significantly underestimated the system’s accuracy when it provided weak, less human-meaningful explanations. Therefore, for intelligent systems with explainable interfaces, this research demonstrates that users are less likely to accurately judge the accuracy of algorithms that do not operate based on human-understandable rationale.},

		This article highlights a use of analogies in science that so far has received relatively little systematic discussion: providing reasons for pursuing a model or theory. Using the development of the liquid drop model as a test case, I critically assess two extant pursuit worthiness accounts: (i) that analogies justify pursuit by supporting plausibility arguments and (ii) that analogies can serve as a guide to potential theoretical unification. Neither of these fit the liquid drop model case. Instead, I develop an alternative account, based on the idea that analogies facilitate the transfer of a well-understood modelling strategy to a new domain.

For a common test of DT, the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), the primary automated approach casts the problem as a semantic distance between a prompt and the resulting idea in a text model. This work presents an alternative approach that greatly surpasses the performance of the best existing semantic distance approaches. Our system, Ocsai, fine-tunes deep neural network-based large-language models (LLMs) on human-judged responses. Trained and evaluated against one of the largest collections of human-judged AUT responses, with 27 thousand responses collected from nine past studies, our fine-tuned large-language-models achieved up to r = 0.81 correlation with human raters, greatly surpassing current systems (r = 0.12–0.26). Further, learning transfers well to new test items and the approach is still robust with small numbers of training labels. We also compare prompt-based zero-shot and few-shot approaches, using GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. This work also suggests a limit to the underlying assumptions of the semantic distance model, showing that a purely semantic approach that uses the stronger language representation of LLMs, while still improving on existing systems, does not achieve comparable improvements to our fine-tuned system. The increase in performance can support stronger applications and interventions in DT and opens the space of automated DT scoring to new areas for improving and understanding this branch of methods.},

Innovation is an interactive process that often involves communication and interaction among employees in a firm and draws on their different qualities from all levels of the organisation. This paper investigates the relation between employee diversity and innovation in terms of gender, age, ethnicity, and education. The analyses draw on data from a recent innovation survey. This data is merged with a linked employer–employee dataset that allow us to identify the employee composition of each firm. We test the hypothesis that employee diversity is associated with better innovative performance. The econometric analysis reveals a positive relation between diversity in education and gender on the likelihood of introducing an innovation. Furthermore, we find a negative effect of age diversity and no significant effect of ethnicity on the firm's likelihood to innovate. In addition, the logistic regression reveals a positive relationship between an open culture towards diversity and innovative performance. We find no support of any curvilinear relation between diversity and innovation.},

This question remains critical as academics, policymakers and activists grapple with the question of how to regulate political discussion on social media. In this study, we contribute to the debate by examining the impact of opposing views within a major climate change skeptic online community on Reddit. A large sample of posts (N = 3000) was manually coded as either dissonant or consonant which allowed the automated classification of the full dataset of more than 50,000 posts, with codes inferred from linked websites. We find that ideologically dissonant submissions act as a stimulant to activity in the community: they received more attention (comments) than consonant submissions, even though they received lower scores through up-voting and down-voting. Users who engaged with dissonant submissions were also more likely to return to the forum.

What if diversity can also improve the bottom line of businesses and other organizations facing complex challenges in the knowledge economy? It can. And The Diversity Bonus shows how and why. Scott Page, a leading thinker, writer, and speaker whose ideas and advice are sought after by corporations, nonprofits, universities, and governments around the world, makes a clear and compellingly pragmatic case for diversity and inclusion. He presents overwhelming evidence that teams that include different kinds of thinkers outperform homogenous groups on complex tasks, producing what he calls diversity bonuses. These bonuses include improved problem solving, increased innovation, and more accurate predictions all of which lead to better performance and results. Page shows that various types of cognitive diversity differences in how people perceive, encode, analyze, and organize the same information and experiencesare linked to better outcomes. He then describes how these cognitive differences are influenced by other kinds of diversity, including racial and gender differencesin other words, identity diversity. Identity diversity, therefore, can also produce bonuses. Drawing on research in economics, psychology, computer science, and many other fields, The Diversity Bonus also tells the stories of people and organizations that have tapped the power of diversity to solve complex problems. And the book includes a challenging response from Katherine Phillips of the Columbia Business School. The result changes the way we think about diversity in the workplaceand far beyond it.},

The Difference is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities.The Difference reveals that progress and innovation may depend less on lone thinkers with enormous IQs than on diverse people working together and capitalizing on their individuality. Page shows how groups that display a range of perspectives outperform groups of like-minded experts. Diversity yields superior outcomes, and Page proves it using his own cutting-edge research. Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, he explains why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you're talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory. He examines practical ways to apply diversity's logic to a host of problems, and along the way offers fascinating and surprising examples, from the redesign of the Chicago "El" to the truth about where we store our ketchup.Page changes the way we understand diversity--how to harness its untapped potential, how to understand and avoid its traps, and how we can leverage our differences for the benefit of all.}

A complex system--such as an economy or a tropical ecosystem--consists of interacting adaptive entities that produce dynamic patterns and structures. Diversity plays a different role in a complex system than it does in an equilibrium system, where it often merely produces variation around the mean for performance measures. In complex adaptive systems, diversity makes fundamental contributions to system performance. Scott Page gives a concise primer on how diversity happens, how it is maintained, and how it affects complex systems. He explains how diversity underpins system level robustness, allowing for multiple responses to external shocks and internal adaptations; how it provides the seeds for large events by creating outliers that fuel tipping points; and how it drives novelty and innovation. Page looks at the different kinds of diversity--variations within and across types, and distinct community compositions and interaction structures--and covers the evolution of diversity within complex systems and the factors that determine the amount of maintained diversity within a system.Provides a concise and accessible introduction Shows how diversity underpins robustness and fuels tipping points Covers all types of diversity The essential primer on diversity in complex adaptive systems},

In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from -1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled. The aim of this tutorial is to guide researchers and clinicians in the appropriate use and interpretation of correlation coefficients.}, number={5}, journal={Anesthesia and Analgesia}, author={Schober, Patrick and Boer, Christa and Schwarte, Lothar A.}, year={2018}, month=may, pages={1763–1768}, language={eng} }

A significant P value of the ANOVA test indicates for at least one pair, between which the mean difference was statistically significant. To identify that significant pair(s), we use multiple comparisons. In ANOVA, when using one categorical independent variable, it is called one-way ANOVA, whereas for two categorical independent variables, it is called two-way ANOVA.

While powerful in prediction accuracy, Deep Learning models are black boxes by nature, preventing users from making informed judgments about the correctness and fairness of such an automated system. Explanations have been proposed as a general remedy to the black box problem. However, it remains unclear if effects of explanations on user trust generalise over varying accuracy levels. In an online user study with 959 participants, we examined the practical consequences of adding explanations for user trust: We evaluated trust for three explanation types on three classifiers of varying accuracy. We find that the influence of our explanations on trust differs depending on the classifier’s accuracy. Thus, the interplay between trust and explanations is more complex than previously reported. Our findings also reveal discrepancies between self-reported and behavioural trust, showing that the choice of trust measure impacts the results.},

For multiple-choice QA examples, we build a dataset of single arguments for both a correct and incorrect answer option in a debate-style set-up as an initial step in training models to produce explanations for two candidate answers. We use long contexts -- humans familiar with the context write convincing explanations for pre-selected correct and incorrect answers, and we test if those explanations allow humans who have not read the full context to more accurately determine the correct answer. We do not find that explanations in our set-up improve human accuracy, but a baseline condition shows that providing human-selected text snippets does improve accuracy.

But today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, sparked by world-renowned computer scientist Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and placed cause and effect on a firm scientific basis. Now, Pearl and science journalist Dana Mackenzie explain causal thinking to general readers for the first time, showing how it allows us to explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It is the essence of human and artificial intelligence. And just as Pearl's discoveries have enabled machines to think better, The Book of Why explains how we too can think better.

In information security, experts need to be able to explain to the public why a system is secure. In both cases, an important goal of explanation is to acquire or maintain the users’ trust. In this paper, I investigate the relation between explanation and trust in the context of computing science. This analysis draws on literature study and concept analysis, using elements from system theory as well as actor-network theory. I apply the conceptual framework to both AI and information security, and show the benefit of the framework for both fields by means of examples. The main focus is on expert systems (AI) and electronic voting systems (security). Finally, I discuss consequences of the analysis for ethics in terms of (un)informed consent and dissent, and the associated division of responsibilities.},

The fundamental distinction between enumerative and eliminative induction is briefly introduced, the former focusing on the mere repetition of phenomena, the latter on the variation of phenomena. The chapter argues that eliminative induction provides a much more plausible and realistic picture of actual scientific practice. Moreover, an account of causation is outlined that corresponds to eliminative induction and that allows establishing the crucial distinction between relationships that are purely accidental and those that allow for prediction and manipulation. The methodological framework sketched in section "Causation" relies on the assumption of determinism, which certainly cannot be upheld for most applications of data science. The chapter sketches an objective, nonfrequency interpretation of probability that relies on symmetries in the causal structure of probabilistic phenomena to establish probability values.}

AI technology is prominently used for talent acquisition in organizations. This research investigates the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition.,This study employs Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Task-Technology-Fit (TTF) framework and proposes a model to explore the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition. The survey was conducted among the 562 human resource managers and talent acquisition managers with a structured questionnaire. The analysis of data was completed using PLS-SEM.,This research reveals that cost-effectiveness, relative advantage, top management support, HR readiness, competitive pressure and support from AI vendors positively affect AI technology adoption for talent acquisition. Security and privacy issues negatively influence the adoption of AI technology. It is found that task and technology characteristics influence the task technology fit of AI technology for talent acquisition. Adoption and task technology fit of AI technology influence the actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. It is revealed that stickiness to traditional talent acquisition methods negatively moderates the association between adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. The proposed model was empirically validated and revealed the predictors of adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition.,This paper provides the predictors of the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition, which is emerging extensively in the human resource domain. It provides vital insights to the human resource managers to benchmark AI technology required for talent acquisition. Marketers can develop their marketing plan considering the factors of adoption. It would help designers to understand the factors of adoption and design the AI technology algorithms and applications for talent acquisition. It contributes to advance the literature of technology adoption by interweaving it with the human resource domain literature on talent acquisition.,This research uniquely validates the model for the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition using the TOE and TTF framework.

However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

Although many supposedly interpretable models have been proposed, there have been relatively few experimental studies investigating whether these models achieve their intended effects, such as making people more closely follow a model’s predictions when it is beneficial for them to do so or enabling them to detect when a model has made a mistake. We present a sequence of pre-registered experiments (N = 3, 800) in which we showed participants functionally identical models that varied only in two factors commonly thought to make machine learning models more or less interpretable: the number of features and the transparency of the model (i.e., whether the model internals are clear or black box). Predictably, participants who saw a clear model with few features could better simulate the model’s predictions. However, we did not find that participants more closely followed its predictions. Furthermore, showing participants a clear model meant that they were less able to detect and correct for the model’s sizable mistakes, seemingly due to information overload. These counterintuitive findings emphasize the importance of testing over intuition when developing interpretable models.},

In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and mitigate bias. Our analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives. Technically, we consider the various choices vendors make regarding data collection and prediction targets, and explore the risks and trade-offs that these choices pose.

We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.},

We examine people’s expectations about the accuracy of algorithms that predict credit default, recidivism of an offender, suitability of a job applicant, and health behavior. Also, we ask whether expectations about algorithm errors vary between these domains and how they differ from expectations about errors made by human experts. In a nationwide representative study (N = 3086) we find that most respondents underestimated the actual errors made by algorithms and are willing to accept even fewer errors than estimated. Error estimates and error acceptance did not differ consistently for predictions made by algorithms or human experts, but people’s living conditions (e.g. unemployment, household income) affected domain-specific acceptance (job suitability, credit defaulting) of misses and false alarms. We conclude that people have unwarranted expectations about the performance of ADM systems and evaluate errors in terms of potential personal consequences. Given the general public’s low willingness to accept errors, we further conclude that acceptance of ADM appears to be conditional to strict accuracy requirements.},

Coverage refers to how often humans think they can predict the model’s behavior, precision to how accurate humans are in those predictions, and effort is either the up-front effort required in interpreting the model, or the effort required to make predictions about a model’s behavior. In this work, we propose anchor-LIME (aLIME), a model-agnostic technique that produces high-precision rule-based explanations for which the coverage boundaries are very clear. We compare aLIME to linear LIME with simulated experiments, and demonstrate the flexibility of aLIME with qualitative examples from a variety of domains and tasks.}

	abstract     = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classiﬁer in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the ﬂexibility of these methods by explaining diﬀerent models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classiﬁcation (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classiﬁer, and identifying why a classiﬁer should not be trusted.},

To address this gap, this paper reports the results of an empirical examination of the impacts of shared leadership in virtual teams. Results confirm the proposed research model. The impacts of shared leadership are multilevel and vary by race and gender. In addition, while shared leadership promotes team satisfaction despite prior assumptions, it actually reduces rather than increases team performance.},

The decision-maker can decide whether to provide these opportunities, or pay a pre-defined monetary value for every withheld opportunity. The decision-maker's objective is to maximize her utility, which is the sum of rewards minus the cost paid for withheld opportunities. We provide a no-regret algorithm that maximizes the decision-maker's utility and complement our analysis with an almost-tight lower bound.

First, in many problems it is difﬁcult for people to provide demonstrations of the desired system trajectory (like a high-DOF robot arm motion or an aggressive driving maneuver), or to even assign how much numerical reward an action or trajectory should get. We build on work in label ranking and propose to learn from preferences (or comparisons) instead: the person provides the system a relative preference between two trajectories. Second, the learned reward function strongly depends on what environments and trajectories were experienced during the training phase. We thus take an active learning approach, in which the system decides on what preference queries to make. A novel aspect of our work is the complexity and continuous nature of the queries: continuous trajectories of a dynamical system in environments with other moving agents (humans or robots). We contribute a method for actively synthesizing queries that satisfy the dynamics of the system. Further, we learn the reward function from a continuous hypothesis space by maximizing the volume removed from the hypothesis space by each query. We assign weights to the hypothesis space in the form of a log-concave distribution and provide a bound on the number of iterations required to converge. We show that our algorithm converges faster to the desired reward compared to approaches that are not active or that do not synthesize queries in an autonomous driving domain. We then run a user study to put our method to the test with real people.},

We study scaling properties of critiquing with both topic-based summarization and synthetic tasks. Larger models write more helpful critiques, and on most tasks, are better at self-critiquing, despite having harder-to-critique outputs. Larger models can also integrate their own self-critiques as feedback, refining their own summaries into better ones. Finally, we motivate and introduce a framework for comparing critiquing ability to generation and discrimination ability. Our measurements suggest that even large models may still have relevant knowledge they cannot or do not articulate as critiques.

On the basis of meta-analytic findings, this article presents the validity of 19 selection procedures for predicting job performance and training performance and the validity of paired combinations of general mental ability (GMA) and Ihe 18 other selection procedures. Overall, the 3 combinations with the highest multivariate validity and utility for job performance were GMA plus a work sample test (mean validity of .63), GMA plus an integrity test (mean validity of .65), and GMA plus a structured interview (mean validity of .63). A further advantage of the latter 2 combinations is that they can be used for both entry level selection and selection of experienced employees. The practical utility implications of these summary findings are substantial. The implications of these research findings for the development of theories of job performance are discussed. From the point of view of practical value, the most important property of a personnel assessment method is predictive validity: the ability to predict future job performance, job-related learning (such as amount of learning in training and development programs), and other criteria. The predictive validity coefficient is directly proportional to the practical economic value (utility) of the assessment method (Brogden, 1949; Schmidt, Hunter, McKenzie, \& Muldrow, 1979). Use of hiring methods with increased predictive validity leads to substantial increases in employee performance as measured in percentage increases in output, increased monetary value of output, and increased learning of job-related skills (Hunter, Schmidt, \& Judiesch, 1990). Today, the validity of different personnel measures can be determined with the aid of 85 years of research. The most wellknown conclusion from this research is that for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance and learning is general mental ability ([GMA], i.e., intelligence or general cognitive ability; Hunter \& Hunter, 1984; Ree \& Earles, 1992). GMA can be measured using commercially available tests. However, many other measures can also contribute to the overall validity of the selection process. These include, for example, measures of}

As the amount of processes automated by artificial intelligence (AI) increases, so does the need to investigate users’ perception. Previous research on explainable AI (XAI) tends to focus on technological optimization. The limited amount of empirical user research leaves key questions unanswered, such as which XAI designs actually improve perceived trustworthiness and observability. We assessed three different visual explanation approaches, consisting of either only a table with classification scores used for classification, or, additionally, one of two different backtraced visual explanations. In a within-subjects design with N = 83 we examined the effects on trust and observability in an online experiment. While observability benefitted from visual explanations, information-rich explanations also led to decreased trust. Explanations can support human-AI interaction, but differentiated effects on trust and observability have to be expected. The suitability of different explanatory approaches for individual AI applications should be further examined to ensure a high level of trust and observability in e.g. automated image processing.},

	abstract     = {How should a firm allocate its limited interviewing resources to select the optimal cohort of new employees from a large set of job applicants? How should that firm allocate cheap but noisy resume screenings and expensive but in-depth in-person interviews? We view this problem through the lens of combinatorial pure exploration (CPE) in the multi-armed bandit setting, where a central learning agent performs costly exploration of a set of arms before selecting a final subset with some combinatorial structure. We generalize a recent CPE algorithm to the setting where arm pulls can have different costs and return different levels of information. We then prove theoretical upper bounds for a general class of arm-pulling strategies in this new setting. We apply our general algorithm to a real-world problem with combinatorial structure: incorporating diversity into university admissions. We take real data from admissions at one of the largest US-based computer science graduate programs and show that a simulation of our algorithm produces a cohort with hiring overall utility while spending comparable budget to the current admissions process at that university.},

In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-\{n\} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.},

If we presume, for the sake of this paper, that machine learning can be a source of knowledge, then it makes sense to wonder what kind of {\textbackslash}em justification it involves. How do we rationalize on the one hand the seeming justificatory black box with the observed wide adoption of machine learning? We argue that, in general, people implicitly adoptreliabilism regarding machine learning. Reliabilism is an epistemological theory of epistemic justification according to which a belief is warranted if it has been produced by a reliable process or method {\textbackslash}citegoldman2012reliabilism. We argue that, in cases where model deployments require {\textbackslash}em moral justification, reliabilism is not sufficient, and instead justifying deployment requires establishing robust human processes as a moral "wrapper'' around machine outputs. We then suggest that, in certain high-stakes domains with moral consequences, reliabilism does not provide another kind of necessary justification---moral justification. Finally, we offer cautions relevant to the (implicit or explicit) adoption of the reliabilist interpretation of machine learning.},

In this paper we introduce a taxonomy and a set of descriptors that can be used to characterise and systematically assess explainable systems along five key dimensions: functional, operational, usability, safety and validation. In order to design a comprehensive and representative taxonomy and associated descriptors we surveyed the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature, extracting the criteria and desiderata that other authors have proposed or implicitly used in their research. The survey includes papers introducing new explainability algorithms to see what criteria are used to guide their development and how these algorithms are evaluated, as well as papers proposing such criteria from both computer science and social science perspectives. This novel framework allows to systematically compare and contrast explainability approaches, not just to better understand their capabilities but also to identify discrepancies between their theoretical qualities and properties of their implementations. We developed an operationalisation of the framework in the form of Explainability Fact Sheets, which enable researchers and practitioners alike to quickly grasp capabilities and limitations of a particular explainable method. When used as a Work Sheet, our taxonomy can guide the development of new explainability approaches by aiding in their critical evaluation along the five proposed dimensions.},

Yet philosophical literature on diversity among scientists has given little attention to distinct concepts of diversity. This is significant because the unappreciated existence of multiple diversity concepts can generate unclarity about the meaning of “diversity,” lead to problematic inferences from empirical research, and obscure complex ethical-epistemic questions about how to define diversity in specific cases. We illustrate some ethical-epistemic implications of our proposal by reference to an example of deliberative mini-publics on human tissue biobanking.},

Drawing parallels to the philosophy of induction, we point out that the no-free-lunch results presuppose a conception of learning algorithms as purely data-driven. On this conception, every algorithm must have an inherent inductive bias, that wants justification. We argue that many standard learning algorithms should rather be understood as model-dependent: in each application they also require for input a model, representing a bias. Generic algorithms themselves, they can be given a model-relative justification.},

The use of the Shapley value is justified by citing [16] showing that it is the {\textbackslash}emph\{unique\} method that satisfies certain good properties ({\textbackslash}emph\{axioms\}). There are, however, a multiplicity of ways in which the Shapley value is operationalized in the attribution problem. These differ in how they reference the model, the training data, and the explanation context. These give very different results, rendering the uniqueness result meaningless. Furthermore, we find that previously proposed approaches can produce counterintuitive attributions in theory and in practice---for instance, they can assign non-zero attributions to features that are not even referenced by the model. In this paper, we use the axiomatic approach to study the differences between some of the many operationalizations of the Shapley value for attribution, and propose a technique called Baseline Shapley (BShap) that is backed by a proper uniqueness result. We also contrast BShap with Integrated Gradients, another extension of Shapley value to the continuous setting.},

In this paper, a large experimental study is conducted to investigate how well-calibrated models produced by a number of algorithms in the scikit-learn library are out-of-the-box, but also if either the built-in calibration techniques Platt scaling and isotonic regression, or Venn-Abers, can be used to improve the calibration. The results show that of the seven algorithms evaluated, the only one obtaining well-calibrated models without the external calibration is logistic regression. All other algorithms, i.e., decision trees, adaboost, gradient boosting, kNN, naive Bayes and random forest beneﬁt from using any of the calibration techniques. In particular, decision trees, Naive Bayes and the boosted models are substantially improved using external calibration. From a practitioner’s perspective, the obvious recommendation becomes to incorporate calibration when using probabilistic prediction. Comparing the diﬀerent calibration techniques, Platt scaling and VennAbers generally outperform isotonic regression, on these rather small datasets. Finally, the unique ability of Venn-Abers to output not only well-calibrated probability estimates, but also the conﬁdence in these estimates is demonstrated.},

	abstract     = {All universities seek to admit a freshmen cohort of a speciﬁed size who will be successful in graduating from college. Previous work has shown a high correlation between students’ eventual success and their ability to do well in their ﬁrst term. This objective translates into admitting students whose ﬁrst term grade point average (GPA) exceeds a minimum acceptable level. Current admissions decisions are based however on a selection index that is constructed from a GPA regression that estimates expected GPA. We consider a new approach in which the selection index is based directly on the quantiles of the GPA distribution. The new approach realistically assumes that student characteristics have diﬀerential impacts at diﬀerent parts of the GPA distribution. Since impacts usually vary for the low, middle and upper parts of the GPA distribution, the quantile approach provides additional information. The quantile method also provides admissions oﬃcers the ﬂexibility to target diﬀerent GPA properties for the freshman class. They can directly implement a criterion that selects students with maximal probability of a ﬁrst term GPA that is better than any speciﬁed value. We illustrate the quantile method by application to actual admission practices at the University of Illinois at Chicago.},

When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play Death of a Salesman , but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie Frozen as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa—who has come home from a tough day of selling—is told by her son Happy, “Come on, Mom. You’re Elsa from Frozen . You have ice powers and you’re a queen. You’re unstoppable.” Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.},

These models are widely used in medicine and criminal justice, but are diﬃcult to learn from data because they need to be calibrated, sparse, use small integer coeﬃcients, and obey application-speciﬁc constraints. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning method to learn risk scores. We formulate the risk score problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, and present a cutting plane algorithm to recover its optimal solution. We improve our algorithm with specialized techniques that generate feasible solutions, narrow the optimality gap, and reduce data-related computation. Our algorithm can train risk scores in a way that scales linearly in the number of samples in a dataset, and that allows practitioners to address application-speciﬁc constraints without parameter tuning or post-processing. We benchmark the performance of diﬀerent methods to learn risk scores on publicly available datasets, comparing risk scores produced by our method to risk scores built using methods that are used in practice. We also discuss the practical beneﬁts of our method through a real-world application where we build a customized risk score for ICU seizure prediction in collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital.},

However, little is known about how potential candidates regard the use of AI as part of the recruitment process and whether or not it influences their likelihood to apply for a job. Our research finds that attitudes towards organizations that use AI in the recruitment process, significantly influences the likelihood that potential candidates will complete the application process. The novelty factor of using AI in the recruitment process, mediates and further positively influences job application likelihood. These positive relationships between attitudes towards the use of AI in the recruitment process and the likelihood of applying for a job have several important practical implications. First, it means that whilst anxiety is naturally present when AI is part of the recruitment process, the anxiety doesn't really affect the completion of job applications and therefore, organizations do not need to spend money on either hiding their use of AI or reducing the anxiety levels of potential candidates. To the contrary, the research suggests that organizations do not need to hide their use of AI in fear of alienating potential candidates, rather organizations may want to promote their use of AI in the recruitment process and focus on potential candidates that already have positive views of both the organization and AI.},

Respect is a natural and integral part of natural human relationships that is seen to shape work and personal relations. In a basic sense, this is the core purpose of smart things: we expect them to be ready and willing to help us. In this vein, we distill the characteristics of more complex respectful behaviours into 4 main types relevant to smart devices, drawing from philosophical analyses of the conceptual dimensions of respect: directive respect, obstacle respect, recognition respect, and care respect. We discuss the implications of each of these kinds of respect for the future of smart personal devices.}

We propose a novel, simple network architecture based solely onan attention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superiorin quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less timeto train. Our single model with 165 million parameters, achieves 27.5 BLEU onEnglish-to-German translation, improving over the existing best ensemble result by over 1 BLEU. On English-to-French translation, we outperform the previoussingle state-of-the-art with model by 0.7 BLEU, achieving a BLEU score of 41.1.}

abstract = {Datafication refers to the practices through which children’s online actions are pervasively recorded, tracked, aggregated, analysed, and exploited by online services in ways including behavioural engineering and monetisation. Previous research has shown that not only do children care significantly about various aspects of datafication, but they demand a chance to take action. Through 10 co-design sessions with 53 children, we examined how children in the UK want to be supported to cope with the datafication practices. Our findings provide insights for creating age-appropriate support for children’s algorithmic literacy development, highlighting and unpacking the importance of no one-size-fitting-all designs to support children’s coping with datafication. We contribute a first understanding of how children aged 7–14 would like to be supported with datafication and what future data-driven digital experiences should be like for them, who demand a shift of the current data ecosystem towards a more humane-by-design and autonomy-supportive future.},

abstract = {AI systems and related algorithms are starting to play a variety of roles in the digital ecosystems of children - being embedded in the connected toys, smart home IoT technologies, apps, and services they interact with on a daily basis. Going forward, AI systems will, in all likelihood, become even more pervasive in children’s applications simply due to their sheer usefulness in creating compelling, adaptive, and personal user experiences. Yet, understanding the ways that AI-driven systems used by children operate, and how AI could be designed to better anticipate and respond to children’s diverse requirements is still a new and emerging area of investigation. Our goals of this workshop are to (1) extend the current critically constructive dialogue around the meaning of child-centred AI design and (2) explore ways to operationalise such child-centred AI design in practice, and finally (3) further expand and foster a community for those who are interested in designing and developing child-centred AI systems.},

In this context, Human-AI Trust has often been tackled from the lens of cognitive science and psychology, but lacks insights from the stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 7 AI practitioners and 7 decision subjects from various decision domains. We found that 1) interviewees identified the prerequisites for the existence of trust and distinguish trust from trustworthiness, reliance, and compliance; 2) trust in AI-integrated systems is strongly influenced by other human actors, more than the system’s features; 3) the role of Human-AI trust factors is stakeholder-dependent. These results provide clues for the design of Human-AI interactions in which trust plays a major role, as well as outline new research directions in Human-AI Trust.},

Our method works by passing documents through a series of weaker language models, running a structured search over possible combinations of their features, and then training a classifier on the selected features to predict whether documents are AI-generated. Crucially, Ghostbuster does not require access to token probabilities from the target model, making it useful for detecting text generated by black-box models or unknown model versions. In conjunction with our model, we release three new datasets of human- and AI-generated text as detection benchmarks in the domains of student essays, creative writing, and news articles. We compare Ghostbuster to a variety of existing detectors, including DetectGPT and GPTZero, as well as a new RoBERTa baseline. Ghostbuster achieves 99.0 F1 when evaluated across domains, which is 5.9 F1 higher than the best preexisting model. It also outperforms all previous approaches in generalization across writing domains (+7.5 F1), prompting strategies (+2.1 F1), and language models (+4.4 F1). We also analyze the robustness of our system to a variety of perturbations and paraphrasing attacks and evaluate its performance on documents written by non-native English speakers.},

	abstract     = {There is increased emphasis on using experimental and quasi-experimental methods to evaluate educational programs; however, educational evaluators and school leaders are often faced with challenges when implementing such designs in educational settings. Use of a historical cohort control group design provides a viable option for conducting quasi-experiments in school-based outcome evaluation. A cohort is a successive group that goes through some experience together, such as a grade level or a training program. A historical cohort comparison group is a cohort group selected from pre-treatment archival data and matched to a subsequent cohort currently receiving a treatment. Although prone to the same threats to study validity as any quasi-experiment, issues related to selection, history, and maturation can be particularly challenging. However, use of a historical cohort control group can reduce noncomparability of treatment and control conditions through local, focal matching. In addition, a historical cohort control group design can alleviate concerns about denying program access to students in order to form a control group, minimize resource requirements and disruption to school routines, and make use of archival data schools and school districts collect and find meaningful.

To the extent that the evaluation of alternatives could be formulated as a predictive task with appropriate metrics, machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used to improve the efficiency of the process. Explanations help to facilitate communication between the algorithm and the human decision-maker, making it easier for the latter to interpret and make decisions on the basis of predictions by the former. Feature-based explanations’ semantics of causal models, however, induce leakage from the decision-maker’s prior beliefs. Our findings from a field experiment demonstrate empirically how this leads to confirmation bias and disparate impact on the decisionmaker’s confidence in the predictions. Such differences can lead to sub-optimal and biased decision outcomes.},

	abstract     = {Automated algorithms are silently making crucial decisions about our lives, but most of the time we have little understanding of how they work. To counter this hidden influence, there have been increasing calls for algorithmic transparency. Much ink has been spilled over the informational account of algorithmic transparency—about how much information should be revealed about the inner workings of an algorithm. But few studies question the power structure beneath the informational disclosure of the algorithm. As a result, the information disclosure itself can be a means of manipulation used by a group of people to advance their own interests. Instead of concentrating on information disclosure, this paper examines algorithmic transpar‑ency from the perspective of power, explaining how algorithmic transparency under a disciplinary power structure can be a technique of normalizing people’s behav‑ior. The informational disclosure of an algorithm can not only set up some de facto norms, but also build a scientific narrative of its algorithm to justify those norms. In doing so, people would be internally motivated to follow those norms with less criti‑cal analysis. This article suggests that we should not simply open the black box of an algorithm without challenging the existing power relations.},

Specifically, based on our review of previous literature, we highlight three desirable properties that ideal AI explanations should satisfy—improve people’s understanding of the AI model, help people recognize the model uncertainty, and support people’s calibrated trust in the model. Through randomized controlled experiments, we evaluate whether four types of common model-agnostic explainable AI methods satisfy these properties on two types of decision making tasks where people perceive themselves as having different levels of domain expertise in (i.e., recidivism prediction and forest cover prediction). Our results show that the effects of AI explanations are largely different on decision making tasks where people have varying levels of domain expertise in, and many AI explanations do not satisfy any of the desirable properties for tasks that people have little domain expertise in. Further, for decision making tasks that people are more knowledgeable, feature contribution explanation is shown to satisfy more desiderata of AI explanations, while the explanation that is considered to resemble how human explain decisions (i.e., counterfactual explanation) does not seem to improve calibrated trust. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for improving the design of XAI methods to better support human decision making.}

We also employ multiple losses and transfer learning from out-of-domain essays to further improve the performance. Experiment results show that our approach derives much benefit from joint learning of multi-scale essay representation and obtains almost the state-of-the-art result among all deep learning models in the ASAP task. Our multi-scale essay representation also generalizes well to CommonLit Readability Prize data set, which suggests that the novel text representation proposed in this paper may be a new and effective choice for long-text tasks.},

	abstractnote = {We’ve heard plenty from politicians and experts on affirmative action and higher education, about how universities should intervene—if at all—to ensure a diverse but deserving student population. But what about those for whom these issues matter the most? In this book, Natasha K. Warikoo deeply explores how students themselves think about merit and race at a uniquely pivotal moment: after they have just won the most competitive game of their lives and gained admittance to one of the world’s top universities.             What Warikoo uncovers—talking with both white students and students of color at Harvard, Brown, and Oxford—is absolutely illuminating; and some of it is positively shocking. As she shows, many elite white students understand the value of diversity abstractly, but they ignore the real problems that racial inequality causes and that diversity programs are meant to solve. They stand in fear of being labeled a racist, but they are quick to call foul should a diversity program appear at all to hamper their own chances for advancement. The most troubling result of this ambivalence is what she calls the “diversity bargain,” in which white students reluctantly agree with affirmative action as long as it benefits them by providing a diverse learning environment—racial diversity, in this way, is a commodity, a selling point on a brochure. And as Warikoo shows, universities play a big part in creating these situations. The way they talk about race on campus and the kinds of diversity programs they offer have a huge impact on student attitudes, shaping them either toward ambivalence or, in better cases, toward more productive and considerate understandings of racial difference.             Ultimately, this book demonstrates just how slippery the notions of race, merit, and privilege can be. In doing so, it asks important questions not just about college admissions but what the elite students who have succeeded at it—who will be the world’s future leaders—will do with the social inequalities of the wider world.},

	abstract     = {Recently, eXplainable AI (XAI) research has focused on the use of counterfactual explanations to address interpretability, algorithmic recourse, and bias in AI system decision-making. The proponents of these algorithms claim they meet users’ requirements for counterfactual explanations. For instance, many claim that the output of their algorithms work as explanations because they prioritise "plausible", "actionable" or "causally important" features in their generated counterfactuals. However, very few of these claims have been tested in controlled psychological studies, and we know very little about which aspects of counterfactual explanations help users to understand AI system decisions. Furthermore, we do not know whether counterfactual explanations are an advance on more traditional causal explanations that have a much longer history in AI (in explaining expert systems and decision trees). Accordingly, we carried out two user studies to (i) test a fundamental distinction in feature-types, between categorical and continuous features, and (ii) compare the relative effectiveness of counterfactual and causal explanations. The studies used a simulated, automated decision-making app that determined safe driving limits after drinking alcohol, based on predicted blood alcohol content, and user responses were measured objectively (users’ predictive accuracy) and subjectively (users’ satisfaction and trust judgments). Study 1 (N=127) showed that users understand explanations referring to categorical features more readily than those referring to continuous features. It also discovered a dissociation between objective and subjective measures: counterfactual explanations elicited higher accuracy of predictions than no-explanation control descriptions but no higher accuracy than causal explanations, yet counterfactual explanations elicited greater satisfaction and trust judgments than causal explanations. Study 2 (N=211) found that users were more accurate for categorically-transformed features compared to continuous ones, and also replicated the results of Study 1. The findings delineate important boundary conditions for current and future counterfactual explanation methods in XAI.},

The paper examines the general functionality of detection tools for AI-generated text and evaluates them based on accuracy and error type analysis. Specifically, the study seeks to answer research questions about whether existing detection tools can reliably differentiate between human-written text and ChatGPT-generated text, and whether machine translation and content obfuscation techniques affect the detection of AI-generated text. The research covers 12 publicly available tools and two commercial systems (Turnitin and PlagiarismCheck) that are widely used in the academic setting. The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AI-generated text. Furthermore, content obfuscation techniques significantly worsen the performance of tools. The study makes several significant contributions. First, it summarises up-to-date similar scientific and non-scientific efforts in the field. Second, it presents the result of one of the most comprehensive tests conducted so far, based on a rigorous research methodology, an original document set, and a broad coverage of tools.

In particular, we study whether this local model-agnostic explanation method can be useful for real human domain experts to assess the correctness of positive predictions, i.e. alerts generated by a classifier. We performed experimentation with three different groups of participants (159 in total), who had basic knowledge of explainable machine learning. We performed a qualitative analysis of recorded reflections of experiment participants performing alert processing with and without SHAP information. The results suggest that the SHAP explanations do impact the decision-making process, although the model's confidence score remains to be a leading source of evidence. We statistically test whether there is a significant difference in task utility metrics between tasks for which an explanation was available and tasks in which it was not provided. As opposed to common intuitions, we did not find a significant difference in alert processing performance when a SHAP explanation is available compared to when it is not.},

However, it remains unclear whether users know what insights an explanation offers and, more importantly, what information it lacks. We conducted an online study with 200 participants to assess explainees' ability to realise known and unknown information for four representative explanations: transparent modelling, decision boundary visualisation, counterfactual explainability and feature importance. Our findings demonstrate that feature importance and decision boundary visualisation are the most comprehensible, but their limitations are not necessarily recognised by the users. In addition, correct interpretation of an explanation -- i.e., understanding known information -- is accompanied by high confidence, but a failure to gauge its limits -- thus grasp unknown information -- yields overconfidence; the latter phenomenon is especially prominent for feature importance and transparent modelling. Machine learning explanations should therefore embrace their richness and limitations to maximise understanding and curb misinterpretation.},

We explored the effects of spatial layout and visual representation in an in-person user study with 33 participants. We measured participants' appropriate trust in the classifier, quantified the effects of different spatial layouts and visual representations, and observed changes in users' trust over time. The results show that each explanation improved users' trust in the classifier, and the combination of explanation, human, and classification algorithm yielded much better decisions than the human and classification algorithm separately. Yet these visual explanations lead to different levels of trust and may cause inappropriate trust if an explanation is difficult to understand. Visual representation and performance feedback strongly affect users' trust, and spatial layout shows a moderate effect. Our results do not support that individual differences (e.g., propensity to trust) affect users' trust in the classifier. This work advances the state-of-the-art in trust-able machine learning and informs the design and appropriate use of automated systems.},

We also propose a new method for obtaining calibrated two-class probability estimates that can be applied to any classifier that produces a ranking of examples. Using naive Bayes and support vector machine classifiers, we give experimental results from a variety of two-class and multiclass domains, including direct marketing, text categorization and digit recognition.}

It is nosurprise then that philosophers since antiquity have been interestedin our experiences of and judgments about beauty and ugliness. Theyhave tried to understand the nature of these experiences andjudgments, and they have also wanted to know whether these experiencesand judgments were legitimate. Both these projects took a sharpenedform in the twentieth century, when this part of our lives came undera sustained attack in both European and North American intellectualcircles. Much of the discourse about beauty since the eighteenthcentury had deployed a notion of the “aesthetic”, and sothat notion in particular came in for criticism. This disdain for theaesthetic may have roots in a broader cultural Puritanism, which fearsthe connection between the aesthetic and pleasure. At one time, fromthe 1960s to the 1990s, even to suggest that an artwork might be goodbecause it is pleasurable, as opposed to cognitively, morally orpolitically beneficial, was to court derision. (This is less truenow.) The twentieth century was not kind to the notions of beauty orthe aesthetic. Nevertheless, there were always somethinkers—philosophers, as well as others in the study ofparticular arts—who persisted in thinking seriously about beautyand the aesthetic. In the first part of this essay, we will look atthe particularly rich account of judgments of beauty given to us byImmanuel Kant. The notion of a “judgment of taste” iscentral to Kant’s account and also to virtually everyone workingin traditional aesthetics; so we begin by examining Kant’scharacterization of the judgment of taste. In the second part, we lookat the issues that twentieth century thinkers raised. In the thirdpart, we consider disinterestedness, which is taken by Kant to be partof the judgment of taste. We end, in the fourth part, by drawing onKant’s account of the judgment of taste to consider whether thenotion of the aesthetic is viable.},

While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate neural fake news: targeted propaganda that closely mimics the style of real news. Modern computer security relies on careful threat modeling: identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities from an adversary's point of view, and exploring potential mitigations to these threats. Likewise, developing robust defenses against neural fake news requires us first to carefully investigate and characterize the risks of these models. We thus present a model for controllable text generation called Grover. Given a headline like 'Link Found Between Vaccines and Autism,' Grover can generate the rest of the article; humans find these generations to be more trustworthy than human-written disinformation. Developing robust verification techniques against generators like Grover is critical. We find that best current discriminators can classify neural fake news from real, human-written, news with 73\% accuracy, assuming access to a moderate level of training data. Counterintuitively, the best defense against Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92\% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of public release of strong generators. We investigate these results further, showing that exposure bias -- and sampling strategies that alleviate its effects -- both leave artifacts that similar discriminators can pick up on. We conclude by discussing ethical issues regarding the technology, and plan to release Grover publicly, helping pave the way for better detection of neural fake news.}

	abstractnote = {As user experience (UX) design continues to grow and expand, designers often work in areas with few design patterns or social mores. It is easy to make things that people do not want or will not adopt. To help avoid this problem, we developed a method called speed dating. This method allows design teams to explore possible futures with target users. Speed dating helps to reduce the risk of making things that people will not adopt. It also discloses opportunities and user needs that design teams might not observe during fieldwork. Over the last decade, we have used this method in many research projects, teaching it to hundreds of UX design students. This article describes the speed dating method, presenting cases to show how speed dating aids UX design.}
